#' Query MongoDB And Fill PostgreSQL
#'
#' This is the high level function executed in step 2 to extract data from the
#'   simulation's No-SQL MongoDB, transform it, and load it into the analytic
#'   PostgreSQL relational database created with `createModSimDb`. This is
#'   executed for one design point at a time.

#'
#' @param mongoConnParam This is a two element named list including the "mongoUri"
#'   which includes the user name and password and a single character string and
#'   the "mongoDb" name as a character string.
#' @param pgConnParam A five element named list containing the following elements:
#'  "pgHost", "pgPort", "pgUser", "pgPass", and "pgDb".
#' @param designPoint This is a single character string with the designPoint you
#'   would like to extract from the MongoDB and place into the PostgreSQL database.
#'   If multiple designPoints are required then execute this function multiple
#'   times. Note that this pulls ALL iterations executed for that designPoint.
#' @param batchSize A numeric integer representing how many records you want to
#'  write to the PostgreSQL database at a time.
#' @param Materialized This is a boolean response if you want to make the view
#'  materialized or not. Materialized views greatly improve the performance of
#'  queries although they duplicate data in memory so they can be costly to
#'  disk space. Default is FALSE.
#'
#' @return This returns messages to the console updating the user on the function's
#'   status but returns no information.
